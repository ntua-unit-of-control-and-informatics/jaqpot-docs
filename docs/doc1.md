# Jaqpot


**Rapid deployment**, efficient **sharing** within your organization

Deploy your models using jaqpot and **integrate** them with your applications


Respect **data privacy** by excanching only the result of your experiments


Accelerate your transformation with **smart applications** and guided decision making


Make your **models transparent and easily accessible** from a user interface that anyone can use



### Develop models on any runtime and deploy them as web services in seconds

Jaqpot can host any model developed by various runtimes. Right now [sklearn](/docs/sklearn), [XGBoost](/docs/xgboost) and [R](/docs/r) is integrated. 
More runtimes will be integrated in the near future, and can be integrated upon request. 

You can contact with the Jaqpot team at contact@euclia.xyz


### Validate your models and generate predictions with a user friendly interface

![Jaqpot](./assets/jui.png)


#### Every model deployed on Jaqpot can be used through a user interface.


> #### Through the user inteface you can:
> - Create predictions by manual input of values
>  
> - Create predictions using CSV datasets using Jaqpot-generated template
>
> - Validate model performance: using an external validation dataset as input in CSV format


### Make them transparent to the users with flexible documentation methods

> #### Through the user inteface you can:
> - Develop
>  
> - Create predictions using CSV datasets using Jaqpot-generated template
>
> - Validate model performance: using an external validation dataset as input in CSV format



### Share your models and make them accessible to selected users, collaborators, or groups

> #### Share with whoever you want:
> - Every user has a personal space and a shared space. 
>  
> - Deploy your models in the personal space and add documentation.
>
> - Share the models with other users or groups having different privileges (Read/Write/Execute).  


### Integrate them with your applications within seconds


> #### Lean, well-documented clients (SDKs) are available for the established programming languages.:
> - Nuget Package (.NET): https://www.nuget.org/packages/JaqpotNet
>  
> - Java: https://search.maven.org/artifact/xyz.euclia/jaqpotj/0.0.1/jar 
>
> - Python Package: https://pypi.org/project/jaqpotpy/  
>
> - Go Package: https://github.com/euclia/gojaqpot 
>
> - Javascript Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@euclia/jaqpot-client  


### Meet the scalability requirements of your organization


> #### Integrate with Jaqpot and create millions of predictions.
> Near real time predictions
>
> Model to prediction in minutes
>
> Low cost of maintenance and development

You can write content using [GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Markdown Syntax

To serve as an example page when styling markdown based Docusaurus sites.

## Headers

# H1 - Create the best documentation

## H2 - Create the best documentation

### H3 - Create the best documentation

#### H4 - Create the best documentation

##### H5 - Create the best documentation

###### H6 - Create the best documentation

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

---

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks

- Or minuses

+ Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com/ or <http://www.example.com/> and sometimes example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/
[1]: http://slashdot.org/
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com/

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png 'Logo Title Text 1')

Reference-style: ![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png 'Logo Title Text 2'

Images from any folder can be used by providing path to file. Path should be relative to markdown file.

## Code

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log('This line can be highlighted!');
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

---

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

---

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
